# BLKDEV 8bit Game

### Overview of BLKDEV

In "BLKDEV", you play as a young developer named "Ori" who is on a quest to find the mighty floppy disk. The disk is said to contain the most powerful code ever written, capable of creating entire worlds and bending reality to its will. Legend has it that the disk was hidden away by a group of ancient programmers who feared its power falling into the wrong hands.

"Ori" sets out on his adventure armed only with his trusty keyboard and a basic set of coding skills. He must traverse a dangerous world filled with bugs, glitches, and deadly hackers who will stop at nothing to keep the disk hidden.

The game is played in a similar style to the original "Legend of Zelda" on NES, with a top-down view and a focus on exploration and puzzle-solving.
 
However, "BLKDEV" adds a twist by incorporating coding challenges into the gameplay. As "Ori" travels through the world, he must write code snippets to unlock doors, defeat enemies, and solve puzzles. The game provides a simple coding interface for players to input their code, making it accessible even to those with no prior coding experience.

As "Ori" progresses through the game, he gains new coding skills and upgrades his keyboard, allowing him to write more powerful code and take on tougher challenges. He also meets other developers along the way, each with their own unique coding abilities and personalities.

At the end of each level, "Ori" must face a final boss in a coding battle. The boss will challenge "Ori" to write the most efficient and powerful code possible, testing his skills and knowledge. If "Ori" succeeds, he will be rewarded with a piece of the map leading to the next level and, eventually, the location of the mighty floppy disk.

As "Ori" gets closer to his goal, he uncovers a sinister plot by the hackers to use the power of the floppy disk for their own nefarious purposes. "Ori" must race against time to reach the disk before they do, using all of his coding skills and wits to overcome the challenges in his path.

In the final showdown, "Ori" faces off against the leader of the hackers in an epic coding battle. The fate of the world hangs in the balance as the two developers face off, typing furiously on their keyboards. In the end, it is "Ori" who emerges victorious, using the power of the floppy disk to create a better world for all.
